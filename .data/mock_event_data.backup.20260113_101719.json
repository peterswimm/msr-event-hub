      "description": "Current LLM inference workloads include tool usage (with system prompts), multi-turn conversations, and application-specific user level prompts. LLM inference workloads are characterized by unpredictability of request processing time both due to dynamic response lengths and due to the KV cache state that could be reused across requests. Reusing the KV cache for previously seen prompts avoids recomputing the KV cache, thereby providing better performance. The potential KV cache reuse over requests is affected by how long the KV cache can stay in the GPU memory before being evicted by incoming requests. To meet the guarantees of SLA attainment of such workloads coupled with unpredictable arrival rates, current pools are typically over-provisioned with multiple replicas serving the same model. This may lead to resource-underutilization. Prior pool-level schedulers assume a static prioritization of KV-cache-hit versus load balancing. Prioritizing KV-cache-hit over load balancing may hurt tail latency. In this project, we build a pool-level scheduler that dynamically adapts based on the current workload and resource characteristics while ensuring SLA attainment, high throughput, and/or low energy usage. We also eagerly offload the KV cache to a memory server shared among replicas, which enables novel performance optimizations including migrating failed requests to new serving replicas with minimal disruption.",

      "name": "Exploring and Automating Novel Optimizations for GPU Matrix Multiplication Kernels using LLMs",
      "description": "GPU based MatMul (Matrix Multiplication) kernels are central to large scale AI systems, especially LLM inference. Thus, optimizing these MatMul kernels can decrease time, energy, and cost of inference, one of the critical services provided by Microsoft. Existing MatMul kernels implement the classic O(n3) algorithm; however, it has been shown that other algorithms, i.e., Strassen, have lower algorithmic complexity of O(n2.81). Despite these theoretical improvements, it is extremely difficult to implement these algorithms in practice due to their irregular and recursive nature, which are not well suited for GPU programming models. In this poster/demo, we present the first highly optimized MatMul implementation (for both single-precision and mixed-precision) using the Strassen algorithm for NVIDIA GPUs. For the critical MatMul kernels found in several popular LLMs (including Llama 3 and Qwen 3-32b), our FP16 Tensor Core implementation runs up to 12% faster than NVIDIA’s optimized kernels.   Writing the above optimized Strassen MatMul kernels took several months of tedious manual programming effort, requiring detailed knowledge of low-level architecture features of NVIDIA GPUs. To aid in such development, we have been developing GPUGenie: an LLM-based GPU kernel optimizer. GPUGenie has a knowledge base of GPU kernel optimizations (written in natural language and easily extensible) and then utilizes this knowledge to iteratively transform (optimize) a GPU kernel. After transformation, GPUGenie automatically validates and profiles the kernel, providing a detailed report to the kernel developer. Currently, GPUGenie can apply complex MatMul kernel optimizations resulting in kernels that are competitive with NVIDIA’s hand optimized kernels. We plan to extend GPUGenie to more complex optimizations, such as the ones that are required for Strassen algorithm, and thus, automating the optimization of performance critical GPU kernels that drive important Microsoft services.",

      "description": "Across the company and the industry, large codebases continue to be written in memory-unsafe languages.  Even code in memory-safe languages is susceptible to security-critical bugs such as buffer reuse or malleability issues.  Pulse is our answer to secure this critical attack surface: a modern, concurrent separation logic that enables scalable and modular proofs of memory safety and optionally functional correctness.  On top of Pulse, we are building tools that bring verification in a production-ready package:   •\tEverParse is a toolchain to automatically generate provably memory-safe and secure binary parsers and serializers, and is replacing hand-written unsafe parsers in CoreOS, Azure CCF, SQL, etc. •\tKuiper is a library for writing generic, memory-safe and data race-free GPU kernels without sacrificing performance, natively supporting low-level atomics and barriers.   •\tC2Pulse is an annotation framework that brings memory-safety to existing C code, without requiring costly and risky rewrites in a different language.  We have ongoing engagements with several teams in CoreOS, SQL, & Azure Storage.",

However, gameplay testing is hard and costly, since games are arbitrarily complex worlds that have to be played in real time, and standard scripting-based automation can be very time consuming and not always possible due to stochastic game elements. In the SmartReplay project, we are developing insights and technology for agents capable of learning to solve complex tasks in rich stochastic environments from few demonstrations. We are focused on retail requirements, so the technology can be more easily adopted in different scenarios, from certification to game development to hardware testing, etc. Our agents learn from video input only, operate the full Xbox controller in real-time. Moreover, our approach is game agnostic and can be applied to any game!",

Yet, these models often fall short of real-time interactivity and struggle to produce novel content beyond their training environments. In this work, we take early steps toward unlocking the full creative potential of world models, making them faster, more flexible, and more controllable. Building on our previous work, WHAM, we introduce a new modelling approach that replaces next-token prediction with discrete diffusion, enabling significant speed-ups with minimal loss in output quality. We explore how new game behaviours can be learned and triggered at inference time in a controlled manner. To this end, we introduce text to control the game environment generated by the model, and curate the BodySwap dataset which simulates a character swapping mechanism, allowing to change the playable character on the fly.  This proof-of-concept highlights the potential of world models as powerful tools for interactive prototyping and user content generation, made possible through intentional data curation and efficient fine-tuning. Our work lays the foundation for real-time, user-driven experimentation in game design and beyond.",

No matter if the data you are interested in lies in your data lake database, local files, web page, or images, agents in Data Formulator can interactively suggest you new exploration directions, transform the data and visualize it to provide you new insights that you may have never considered. When you want to take in control of the analysis direction, simply leverage the multi-modal \"data threads\" interface to steer the exploration -- either you want to branch out, revisit, reuse or followup for a deep dive. Behind the scene, Data Formulator leverages an event-driven asynchronous agent design where different AI agents collaboratively work with the user to recommend, code, and explain data to let users fluently VIBE with data.",

      "description": "Current LLM inference workloads include tool usage (with system prompts), multi-turn conversations, and application-specific user level prompts. LLM inference workloads are characterized by unpredictability of request processing time both due to dynamic response lengths and due to the KV cache state that could be reused across requests. Reusing the KV cache for previously seen prompts avoids recomputing the KV cache, thereby providing better performance. The potential KV cache reuse over requests is affected by how long the KV cache can stay in the GPU memory before being evicted by incoming requests. To meet the guarantees of SLA attainment of such workloads coupled with unpredictable arrival rates, current pools are typically over-provisioned with multiple replicas serving the same model. This may lead to resource-underutilization. Prior pool-level schedulers assume a static prioritization of KV-cache-hit versus load balancing. Prioritizing KV-cache-hit over load balancing may hurt tail latency. In this project, we build a pool-level scheduler that dynamically adapts based on the current workload and resource characteristics while ensuring SLA attainment, high throughput, and/or low energy usage. We also eagerly offload the KV cache to a memory server shared among replicas, which enables novel performance optimizations including migrating failed requests to new serving replicas with minimal disruption.",

      "description": "GPU based MatMul (Matrix Multiplication) kernels are central to large scale AI systems, especially LLM inference. Thus, optimizing these MatMul kernels can decrease time, energy, and cost of inference, one of the critical services provided by Microsoft. Existing MatMul kernels implement the classic O(n3) algorithm; however, it has been shown that other algorithms, i.e., Strassen, have lower algorithmic complexity of O(n2.81). Despite these theoretical improvements, it is extremely difficult to implement these algorithms in practice due to their irregular and recursive nature, which are not well suited for GPU programming models. In this poster/demo, we present the first highly optimized MatMul implementation (for both single-precision and mixed-precision) using the Strassen algorithm for NVIDIA GPUs. For the critical MatMul kernels found in several popular LLMs (including Llama 3 and Qwen 3-32b), our FP16 Tensor Core implementation runs up to 12% faster than NVIDIA’s optimized kernels.   Writing the above optimized Strassen MatMul kernels took several months of tedious manual programming effort, requiring detailed knowledge of low-level architecture features of NVIDIA GPUs. To aid in such development, we have been developing GPUGenie: an LLM-based GPU kernel optimizer. GPUGenie has a knowledge base of GPU kernel optimizations (written in natural language and easily extensible) and then utilizes this knowledge to iteratively transform (optimize) a GPU kernel. After transformation, GPUGenie automatically validates and profiles the kernel, providing a detailed report to the kernel developer. Currently, GPUGenie can apply complex MatMul kernel optimizations resulting in kernels that are competitive with NVIDIA’s hand optimized kernels. We plan to extend GPUGenie to more complex optimizations, such as the ones that are required for Strassen algorithm, and thus, automating the optimization of performance critical GPU kernels that drive important Microsoft services.",

However, gameplay testing is hard and costly, since games are arbitrarily complex worlds that have to be played in real time, and standard scripting-based automation can be very time consuming and not always possible due to stochastic game elements. In the SmartReplay project, we are developing insights and technology for agents capable of learning to solve complex tasks in rich stochastic environments from few demonstrations. We are focused on retail requirements, so the technology can be more easily adopted in different scenarios, from certification to game development to hardware testing, etc. Our agents learn from video input only, operate the full Xbox controller in real-time. Moreover, our approach is game agnostic and can be applied to any game!",

      "description": "Recent advances in world models have enabled the generation of gameplay sequences that respond to user input, opening up exciting possibilities for creative applications such as rapid prototyping of game ideas. Yet, these models often fall short of real-time interactivity and struggle to produce novel content beyond their training environments. In this work, we take early steps toward unlocking the full creative potential of world models, making them faster, more flexible, and more controllable. Building on our previous work, WHAM, we introduce a new modelling approach that replaces next-token prediction with discrete diffusion, enabling significant speed-ups with minimal loss in output quality. We explore how new game behaviours can be learned and triggered at inference time in a controlled manner. To this end, we introduce text to control the game environment generated by the model, and curate the BodySwap dataset which simulates a character swapping mechanism, allowing to change the playable character on the fly.  This proof-of-concept highlights the potential of world models as powerful tools for interactive prototyping and user content generation, made possible through intentional data curation and efficient fine-tuning. Our work lays the foundation for real-time, user-driven experimentation in game design and beyond.",

When you want to take in control of the analysis direction, simply leverage the multi-modal \"data threads\" interface to steer the exploration -- either you want to branch out, revisit, reuse or followup for a deep dive. Behind the scene, Data Formulator leverages an event-driven asynchronous agent design where different AI agents collaboratively work with the user to recommend, code, and explain data to let users fluently VIBE with data.",
