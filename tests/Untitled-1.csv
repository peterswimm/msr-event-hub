Roshan Dathathri	Adaptive Scheduler for LLM Inference Request Routing and Migration	Systems & Networking 	Inference 2030	Current LLM inference workloads include tool usage (with system prompts), multi-turn conversations, and application-specific user level prompts. LLM inference workloads are characterized by unpredictability of request processing time both due to dynamic response lengths and due to the KV cache state that could be reused across requests. Reusing the KV cache for previously seen prompts avoids recomputing the KV cache, thereby providing better performance. The potential KV cache reuse over requests is affected by how long the KV cache can stay in the GPU memory before being evicted by incoming requests. To meet the guarantees of SLA attainment of such workloads coupled with unpredictable arrival rates, current pools are typically over-provisioned with multiple replicas serving the same model. This may lead to resource-underutilization. Prior pool-level schedulers assume a static prioritization of KV-cache-hit versus load balancing. Prioritizing KV-cache-hit over load balancing may hurt tail latency. In this project, we build a pool-level scheduler that dynamically adapts based on the current workload and resource characteristics while ensuring SLA attainment, high throughput, and/or low energy usage. We also eagerly offload the KV cache to a memory server shared among replicas, which enables novel performance optimizations including migrating failed requests to new serving replicas with minimal disruption. 	aashakashah, ajangda, burcucanakci, dnarayan, samehe, sburchka, #Inference2030	None	Azure AI	Demo only or Demo + Poster	5 x 2 table with large display (no posterboard)	1505		On Main Floor		Confirmed	Large display, wants 5 x 2 desk, keyboard/mouse	1			9/8/25 15:12:10	9/8/25 15:15:41	TRUE				
Abhinav Jangda	Exploring and Automating Novel Optimizations for GPU Matrix Multiplication Kernels using LLMs	Programming Languages & Software Engineering	Inference 2030	"GPU based MatMul (Matrix Multiplication) kernels are central to large scale AI systems, especially LLM inference. Thus, optimizing these MatMul kernels can decrease time, energy, and cost of inference, one of the critical services provided by Microsoft. Existing MatMul kernels implement the classic O(n3) algorithm; however, it has been shown that other algorithms, i.e., Strassen, have lower algorithmic complexity of O(n2.81). Despite these theoretical improvements, it is extremely difficult to implement these algorithms in practice due to their irregular and recursive nature, which are not well suited for GPU programming models. In this poster/demo, we present the first highly optimized MatMul implementation (for both single-precision and mixed-precision) using the Strassen algorithm for NVIDIA GPUs. For the critical MatMul kernels found in several popular LLMs (including Llama 3 and Qwen 3-32b), our FP16 Tensor Core implementation runs up to 12% faster than NVIDIA’s optimized kernels.
 
Writing the above optimized Strassen MatMul kernels took several months of tedious manual programming effort, requiring detailed knowledge of low-level architecture features of NVIDIA GPUs. To aid in such development, we have been developing GPUGenie: an LLM-based GPU kernel optimizer. GPUGenie has a knowledge base of GPU kernel optimizations (written in natural language and easily extensible) and then utilizes this knowledge to iteratively transform (optimize) a GPU kernel. After transformation, GPUGenie automatically validates and profiles the kernel, providing a detailed report to the kernel developer. Currently, GPUGenie can apply complex MatMul kernel optimizations resulting in kernels that are competitive with NVIDIA’s hand optimized kernels. We plan to extend GPUGenie to more complex optimizations, such as the ones that are required for Strassen algorithm, and thus, automating the optimization of performance critical GPU kernels that drive important Microsoft services."	ajangda, tsorensen, #Inference2030	https://microsoft-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/p/ajangda/Ec9aXWaSQLpNimtFfVKk1NoB43Zj6rDO3EbZhj6blAEKig?e=cb1iUH	AI Frameworks, Athena	Demo only or Demo + Poster	5 x 2 table with large display (no posterboard)	1505		On Main Floor		Confirmed	No 5 x 2 table needed	1			9/8/25 14:33:52	9/8/25 15:02:08	TRUE				
Gabriel Ebner	Proofs à la Carte: Verified Code with Pulse	Programming Languages & Software Engineering	Programming Languages/Software	"Across the company and the industry, large codebases continue to be written in memory-unsafe languages.  Even code in memory-safe languages is susceptible to security-critical bugs such as buffer reuse or malleability issues.  Pulse is our answer to secure this critical attack surface: a modern, concurrent separation logic that enables scalable and modular proofs of memory safety and optionally functional correctness.

On top of Pulse, we are building tools that bring verification in a production-ready package: 

•	EverParse is a toolchain to automatically generate provably memory-safe and secure binary parsers and serializers, and is replacing hand-written unsafe parsers in CoreOS, Azure CCF, SQL, etc.
•	Kuiper is a library for writing generic, memory-safe and data race-free GPU kernels without sacrificing performance, natively supporting low-level atomics and barriers.  
•	C2Pulse is an annotation framework that brings memory-safety to existing C code, without requiring costly and risky rewrites in a different language.

We have ongoing engagements with several teams in CoreOS, SQL, & Azure Storage.

Sergio Valcarcel Macua	SmartReplay: AI agents for gameplay testing	AI Agents (Interactive, Embodied and Devices)	AI Agents (Interactive, Embodied, Devices)	Like in any software, video game testing is critical to ensuring high quality titles. However, gameplay testing is hard and costly, since games are arbitrarily complex worlds that have to be played in real time, and standard scripting-based automation can be very time consuming and not always possible due to stochastic game elements. In the SmartReplay project, we are developing insights and technology for agents capable of learning to solve complex tasks in rich stochastic environments from few demonstrations. We are focused on retail requirements, so the technology can be more easily adopted in different scenarios, from certification to game development to hardware testing, etc. Our agents learn from video input only, operate the full Xbox controller in real-time. Moreover, our approach is game agnostic and can be applied to any game!	clovett, t-luschaefer, pallavic, sergiov, kahofman, t-wenlinda, tony, adonnell, qjamil, rageorg, dabignel, sarahparisot	https://microsofteur.sharepoint.com/:p:/t/SmartReplay/EcmP_DyYxVJFmlhFD93az1sB6bQR8ZFUz7_-gHLwRkF-ZQ?e=GGWiYS	"Dave McCarthy (Xbox) damccart@microsoft.com

Sarah Parisot	Real-Time Text-Conditioned World Models for Interactive Prototyping	AI/ML Foundations	AI ML Foundations	"Recent advances in world models have enabled the generation of gameplay sequences that respond to user input, opening up exciting possibilities for creative applications such as rapid prototyping of game ideas. Yet, these models often fall short of real-time interactivity and struggle to produce novel content beyond their training environments.
In this work, we take early steps toward unlocking the full creative potential of world models, making them faster, more flexible, and more controllable. Building on our previous work, WHAM, we introduce a new modelling approach that replaces next-token prediction with discrete diffusion, enabling significant speed-ups with minimal loss in output quality.
We explore how new game behaviours can be learned and triggered at inference time in a controlled manner. To this end, we introduce text to control the game environment generated by the model, and curate the BodySwap dataset which simulates a character swapping mechanism, allowing to change the playable character on the fly. 
This proof-of-concept highlights the potential of world models as powerful tools for interactive prototyping and user content generation, made possible through intentional data curation and efficient fine-tuning. Our work lays the foundation for real-time, user-driven experimentation in game design and beyond."	"Raluca Stevenson (rageorg), Dave Bignell (dabignell), Jennifer C.

Roshan Dathathri	Adaptive Scheduler for LLM Inference Request Routing and Migration	Systems & Networking 	Inference 2030	Current LLM inference workloads include tool usage (with system prompts), multi-turn conversations, and application-specific user level prompts. LLM inference workloads are characterized by unpredictability of request processing time both due to dynamic response lengths and due to the KV cache state that could be reused across requests. Reusing the KV cache for previously seen prompts avoids recomputing the KV cache, thereby providing better performance. The potential KV cache reuse over requests is affected by how long the KV cache can stay in the GPU memory before being evicted by incoming requests. To meet the guarantees of SLA attainment of such workloads coupled with unpredictable arrival rates, current pools are typically over-provisioned with multiple replicas serving the same model. This may lead to resource-underutilization. Prior pool-level schedulers assume a static prioritization of KV-cache-hit versus load balancing. Prioritizing KV-cache-hit over load balancing may hurt tail latency. In this project, we build a pool-level scheduler that dynamically adapts based on the current workload and resource characteristics while ensuring SLA attainment, high throughput, and/or low energy usage. We also eagerly offload the KV cache to a memory server shared among replicas, which enables novel performance optimizations including migrating failed requests to new serving replicas with minimal disruption. 	aashakashah, ajangda, burcucanakci, dnarayan, samehe, sburchka, #Inference2030	None	Azure AI	Demo only or Demo + Poster	5 x 2 table with large display (no posterboard)	1505		On Main Floor		Confirmed	Large display, wants 5 x 2 desk, keyboard/mouse	1			9/8/25 15:12:10	9/8/25 15:15:41	TRUE				
Abhinav Jangda	Exploring and Automating Novel Optimizations for GPU Matrix Multiplication Kernels using LLMs	Programming Languages & Software Engineering	Inference 2030	"GPU based MatMul (Matrix Multiplication) kernels are central to large scale AI systems, especially LLM inference. Thus, optimizing these MatMul kernels can decrease time, energy, and cost of inference, one of the critical services provided by Microsoft. Existing MatMul kernels implement the classic O(n3) algorithm; however, it has been shown that other algorithms, i.e., Strassen, have lower algorithmic complexity of O(n2.81). Despite these theoretical improvements, it is extremely difficult to implement these algorithms in practice due to their irregular and recursive nature, which are not well suited for GPU programming models. In this poster/demo, we present the first highly optimized MatMul implementation (for both single-precision and mixed-precision) using the Strassen algorithm for NVIDIA GPUs. For the critical MatMul kernels found in several popular LLMs (including Llama 3 and Qwen 3-32b), our FP16 Tensor Core implementation runs up to 12% faster than NVIDIA’s optimized kernels.
 
Writing the above optimized Strassen MatMul kernels took several months of tedious manual programming effort, requiring detailed knowledge of low-level architecture features of NVIDIA GPUs. To aid in such development, we have been developing GPUGenie: an LLM-based GPU kernel optimizer. GPUGenie has a knowledge base of GPU kernel optimizations (written in natural language and easily extensible) and then utilizes this knowledge to iteratively transform (optimize) a GPU kernel. After transformation, GPUGenie automatically validates and profiles the kernel, providing a detailed report to the kernel developer. Currently, GPUGenie can apply complex MatMul kernel optimizations resulting in kernels that are competitive with NVIDIA’s hand optimized kernels. We plan to extend GPUGenie to more complex optimizations, such as the ones that are required for Strassen algorithm, and thus, automating the optimization of performance critical GPU kernels that drive important Microsoft services."	ajangda, tsorensen, #Inference2030	https://microsoft-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/p/ajangda/Ec9aXWaSQLpNimtFfVKk1NoB43Zj6rDO3EbZhj6blAEKig?e=cb1iUH	AI Frameworks, Athena	Demo only or Demo + Poster	5 x 2 table with large display (no posterboard)	1505		On Main Floor		Confirmed	No 5 x 2 table needed	1			9/8/25 14:33:52	9/8/25 15:02:08	TRUE				
Gabriel Ebner	Proofs à la Carte: Verified Code with Pulse	Programming Languages & Software Engineering	Programming Languages/Software	"Across the company and the industry, large codebases continue to be written in memory-unsafe languages.  Even code in memory-safe languages is susceptible to security-critical bugs such as buffer reuse or malleability issues.  Pulse is our answer to secure this critical attack surface: a modern, concurrent separation logic that enables scalable and modular proofs of memory safety and optionally functional correctness.

On top of Pulse, we are building tools that bring verification in a production-ready package: 

•	EverParse is a toolchain to automatically generate provably memory-safe and secure binary parsers and serializers, and is replacing hand-written unsafe parsers in CoreOS, Azure CCF, SQL, etc.
•	Kuiper is a library for writing generic, memory-safe and data race-free GPU kernels without sacrificing performance, natively supporting low-level atomics and barriers.  
•	C2Pulse is an annotation framework that brings memory-safety to existing C code, without requiring costly and risky rewrites in a different language.

We have ongoing engagements with several teams in CoreOS, SQL, & Azure Storage.

Sergio Valcarcel Macua	SmartReplay: AI agents for gameplay testing	AI Agents (Interactive, Embodied and Devices)	AI Agents (Interactive, Embodied, Devices)	Like in any software, video game testing is critical to ensuring high quality titles. However, gameplay testing is hard and costly, since games are arbitrarily complex worlds that have to be played in real time, and standard scripting-based automation can be very time consuming and not always possible due to stochastic game elements. In the SmartReplay project, we are developing insights and technology for agents capable of learning to solve complex tasks in rich stochastic environments from few demonstrations. We are focused on retail requirements, so the technology can be more easily adopted in different scenarios, from certification to game development to hardware testing, etc. Our agents learn from video input only, operate the full Xbox controller in real-time.

Sarah Parisot	Real-Time Text-Conditioned World Models for Interactive Prototyping	AI/ML Foundations	AI ML Foundations	"Recent advances in world models have enabled the generation of gameplay sequences that respond to user input, opening up exciting possibilities for creative applications such as rapid prototyping of game ideas. Yet, these models often fall short of real-time interactivity and struggle to produce novel content beyond their training environments.
In this work, we take early steps toward unlocking the full creative potential of world models, making them faster, more flexible, and more controllable. Building on our previous work, WHAM, we introduce a new modelling approach that replaces next-token prediction with discrete diffusion, enabling significant speed-ups with minimal loss in output quality.
We explore how new game behaviours can be learned and triggered at inference time in a controlled manner. To this end, we introduce text to control the game environment generated by the model, and curate the BodySwap dataset which simulates a character swapping mechanism, allowing to change the playable character on the fly. 
This proof-of-concept highlights the potential of world models as powerful tools for interactive prototyping and user content generation, made possible through intentional data curation and efficient fine-tuning. Our work lays the foundation for real-time, user-driven experimentation in game design and beyond."	"Raluca Stevenson (rageorg), Dave Bignell (dabignell), Jennifer C.

Patricia Kovaleski	Democratizing Decision Intelligence with Fabric Data Scientist	AI for Work and Society	AI Health Work Society	Our goal with Fabric Data Scientist is to make data-driven decisions accessible to all, by designing a no-code Data Agent that empowers users to define business intent and receive plain-language, actionable recommendations. To this end, Fabric Data Scientist leverages advanced research and analytics tools from multiple research labs across Microsoft: universal predictor (GSL, Azure Data), causality (EconML, MSR tri-labs), and optimization techniques (OptiGuide, MSR Redmond). The combination of tools allows answering complex business questions that would normally require expert knowledge from multiple fields. We will show a demo of Fabric Data Scientist in action, and discuss ongoing work and research challenges, including tool selection, dealing with ambiguity, and interpretation of LLM outputs.	ishai, kmellou, lumarsha, hugobarbalho, pkovaleski, andreas.mueller, kebatt, ansonho, Carlo.Curino, dmoldavskaya, Eleanor.Dillon, kevingao, marcozo, Markus.Weimer	"https://microsoft-my.sharepoint.com/:p:/p/dmoldavskaya/EeTHKmP_MORBsBPW70SHdfIB2ZmsvVq6V290z9nszU7ZBg?e=VNBsyx

Andy Wilson	Storycaster: Immersive Room-Based Storytelling using Generative AI	HCI	HCI	Storycaster transforms the physical world into a responsive storytelling environment. It uses generative AI techniques to change the appearance and sound of the room around you. Unlike headset-based VR, Storycaster preserves spatial awareness, using live camera feeds to augment the walls with cylindrical projections, creating worlds that blend with the physical surroundings. A narrator agent co-creates stories that evolve in response to voice commands, with each scene enhanced by generated ambient audio, dialogue, and imagery.	awilson, judithamores, annpar	n/a	Xbox AI	Demo only or Demo + Poster	We have special requirements, e.g., specialty space (present in your own lab), audio isolation, or room for VR or other equipment, etc.	3315	The demo will be in 99/3315.	Off Floor Dedicated space needed	"This could benefit from being colocated with other demos from the FX group.

There is some concern about how to get people up to the third floor. One idea is to have a poster for the system on the first floor. Whoever is presenting at that poster can then optionally direct people upstairs to the demo in 3315.

Another concern is that currently the demo is a single-user experience that can take 20 minutes or more.
